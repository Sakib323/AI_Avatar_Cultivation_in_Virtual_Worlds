We made a special world using Unity, where you can explore with VR glasses connected to a brain headset and a microphone. To move, you just need to think, and the system turns your thoughts into actions like going forward or backward. Friends can join and explore together, and there are lots of things to do.

The non-playing characters (NPCs) in the game are super advanced. They seem conscious because of their AI model. These NPCs can adapt based on how players interact with them, mimicking basic human emotions. Over time, they become even more advanced.

Here's what we changed:

Our custom VR headset lets you control the game using your thoughts. You don't need a controller to play.

In the game, NPCs have their own thoughts and emotions that develop through player interactions. It's hard to tell the difference between a player and an NPC, similar to the character Guy in Free City.

How our system works:

It's not just a game; it's a world where people can meet up. The world is built on Unity. For NPCs, we use an AI pipeline with a text generation model, sentiment analysis model, image classifier, and intent recognizer. When a player makes a move or statement, these AI models create output through the pipeline, and the NPC responds accordingly.

Our VR headset picks up electrical signals from your brain when you think of an action. It sends these signals to the AI model to recognize your thoughts and make actions accordingly.

How to explore the world:

Install the app, connect your custom VR headset, and join the world. Find your friends or track their real-time location in the game with their ID on the tracker. Communicate using the microphone. Each player gets an NPC companion to help them on missions or quests.

Inspiration:

Our concept is inspired by the anime "Sword Art Online," where the main character explores a virtual reality world. Like in the show, our product transforms how we play games, learn, connect, and explore in a shared virtual space.

Mythological Concept in the World:

We've included mythological concepts from various religions, like Islam and Hinduism. Our virtual world is enriched with symbolism, drawing inspiration from the Islamic concept of the seven skies. Each sky represents a unique dimension, and users can visit other dimensions through portals under certain conditions.
